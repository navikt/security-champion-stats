# Copilot Instructions for Security champions levels

**EXTREMELY IMPORTANT**:
- Break up changes into smaller tasks and verify functionality before moving on.
  If in doubt, ask for clarification. For example, if asked to implement functionality for fetching a set of data.
  Do not stray outside of this task. Ask if the user wants you to add documentation or extend the functionality
  of the initial request.
- Do NOT do add anything comprehensive unless specifically instructed.
- Do NOT add documentation unless specifically asked.
- Do NOT add comments in code unless the logic is VERY complex.
- The user will verify functionality manually and ask for changes if needed. No need to build or run the application for verification.
- **DO NOT ADD EXTRA DOCUMENTATION OR EXPLANATIONS UNLESS SPECIFICALLY ASKED.**
- Do not use timeout when running terminal commands, we are running zsh on macos.
- When adding or removing functionality we update the root README.md with relevant information. Keep the information here VERY concise and to the point. For example when adding or removing a package or refactoring existing folder structure.
